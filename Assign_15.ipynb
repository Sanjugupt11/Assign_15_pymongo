    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "Answer:- MongoDB is a non-relational document database that provides support for JSON-like storage. The MongoDB database \n",
    "has a flexible data model that enables you to store unstructured data, and it provides full indexing support, and\n",
    "replication with rich and intuitive APIs.\n",
    "A non-relational database is a database that does not use the tabular schema of rows and columns found in most traditional \n",
    "database systems. Instead, non-relational databases use a storage model that is optimized for the specific requirements of \n",
    "the type of data being stored.\n",
    "NoSQL databases like MongoDB are a good choice when your data is document-centric and doesnt fit well into the schema of a\n",
